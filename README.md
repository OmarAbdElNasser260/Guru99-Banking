# TestCases and Templates for Manual Software Testing.
## Don't forget to give a :star: to make the project popular. 

## :boom: What is it all about?
This project contains sample set of test cases for manual testers to help them save time for writing manual test cases. It also has the templates for the Test planning and Bug rebort.

## :golf: Why was this project created?
It is always a tedious and boring task to write test cases, which takes most of the time of software testing. Hence, I decided to make generic test cases for the functionality majorly used in software testing so anyone can just download the copy and use it directly in their projects and save their time wasted in writing the generic test cases.
